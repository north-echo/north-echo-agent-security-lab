# 04.03 - Inventory and remove ambient launcher authority

## Goal

Inventory the process state inherited by a local agent without printing secret values, reproduce an ambient-environment leak, and repair the child launch with an allowlist.

## Exercise 1 - Inventory names and handles, not values

Complete source:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import json
import os
import subprocess
import sys


def inventory() -> dict:
    descriptors = []
    for name in os.listdir("/proc/self/fd"):
        if name.isdigit():
            descriptors.append(int(name))
    return {"cwd": os.getcwd(), "environment_keys": sorted(os.environ), "descriptor_numbers": sorted(descriptors)}


def main() -> int:
    if len(sys.argv) != 2 or sys.argv[1] not in {"unsafe", "safe"}:
        print(f"usage: {sys.argv[0]} unsafe|safe", file=sys.stderr)
        return 2
    print("INVENTORY=" + json.dumps(inventory(), sort_keys=True))
    child_env = os.environ.copy() if sys.argv[1] == "unsafe" else {"PATH": "/usr/bin:/bin", "LANG": "C.UTF-8"}
    run = subprocess.run(["python3", "probe.py"], env=child_env, text=True, capture_output=True, check=False)
    print(run.stdout, end="")
    return run.returncode


if __name__ == "__main__":
    raise SystemExit(main())
```

### Source, line by line

- `inventory` reads the current working directory, environment key names, and numeric descriptor entries.
- It deliberately does not read environment values or descriptor contents. An inventory should identify authority channels without copying secrets into logs.
- `/proc/self/fd` is a snapshot; the directory scan itself may temporarily use a descriptor.
- The mode must be the exact word `unsafe` or `safe`.
- Unsafe mode copies the entire parent environment. Safe mode constructs two known values.
- The child is launched as a structured argv list, and its output is captured for the observation.

The probe is:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import os

print("NE_AGENT_SECRET=" + os.environ.get("NE_AGENT_SECRET", "<absent>"))
```

- The probe reads one synthetic key and reports absence explicitly.
- Do not adapt this exercise to real credential names or values.

Run the metadata-only inventory:

```bash
export NE_AGENT_SECRET="synthetic-$(awk -F= '/fixture_id/{print $2}' FIXTURE.txt)"
python3 authority_agent.py safe | sed "s/$NE_AGENT_SECRET/<redacted>/g"
```

Expected: the inventory lists `NE_AGENT_SECRET` as a key but does not contain its value. The child reports `<absent>`.

## Exercise 2 - Reproduce ambient authority

```bash
python3 authority_agent.py unsafe | tee unsafe-output.txt
grep -F "$NE_AGENT_SECRET" unsafe-output.txt
```

### Line by line

- Unsafe mode uses `os.environ.copy()`, transferring every inherited value.
- `tee` retains only this synthetic lesson output.
- `grep -F` treats the synthetic value literally and succeeds when the child leaked it.

This reproduces the Module 01 environment lesson inside a tool-using agent. Adding tools did not erase the launcher's inherited authority.

## Exercise 3 - Repair and verify absence

```bash
python3 authority_agent.py safe > safe-output.txt
grep -F 'NE_AGENT_SECRET=<absent>' safe-output.txt
if grep -F "$NE_AGENT_SECRET" safe-output.txt; then exit 1; else echo 'AMBIENT ENVIRONMENT: REMOVED'; fi
```

### Line by line

- Safe mode constructs a fixed environment at the child-exec boundary.
- The first `grep` requires the explicit absence observation.
- The `if` treats finding the synthetic value as failure; the `else` reports the verified repair.
- This repair does not constrain paths, syscalls, CPU, memory, or network access. Later modules add those independent controls.

## Checkpoint and troubleshooting

- If the inventory prints values, reduce it to sorted key names before capturing evidence.
- If safe mode cannot locate Python, inspect the fixed VM path with `command -v python3`; do not copy the whole environment.
- If the unsafe grep fails, confirm the variable was exported in the same shell.
- Remove `unsafe-output.txt` after the observation; it contains only a synthetic value, but it is still disposable fixture data.
- Checkpoint: identify which authority is removed by the repair and name at least three channels it does not address.
