# Module 08 - Isolate the network and mediate egress

Remove the workload's inherited IP network, then expose only a narrow HTTP capability through a filesystem Unix socket. The broker uses an explicit synthetic name-to-loopback map, binds requests to a run identity, and authorizes every redirect again.

Play in order: `08.01`, `08.02`, `08.03`, then `module-08`.

Outcomes:

- prove a new network namespace starts with loopback down and cannot reach a service on host loopback;
- distinguish removing direct IP connectivity from authorizing one mediated operation;
- carry a structured request over `AF_UNIX` without restoring an IP route;
- authorize a synthetic hostname, resolved address, port, path shape, and run identity;
- reauthorize redirects before contacting their destinations;
- bound request and response sizes and cleanly remove the broker socket.

All services are synthetic and bind only to `127.0.0.1`. The exercises do not create veth devices, routes, firewall rules, DNS traffic, or public requests. Prerequisites are Modules 01-07 and Linux support for unprivileged user plus network namespaces.
