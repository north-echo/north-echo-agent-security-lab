# 05.02 - Make lookup descriptor-relative with `openat2`

## Goal

Replace check-then-open pathname logic with one kernel operation anchored to an already-open directory. Require resolution to remain beneath that descriptor and reject symlinks.

## Exercise 1 - Compile the brokered open

Complete source of `safe_open.c`:

```c
#define _GNU_SOURCE
#include <errno.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <linux/openat2.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <sys/syscall.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    if (argc != 3) {
        fprintf(stderr, "usage: %s ROOT RELATIVE_PATH\n", argv[0]);
        return 2;
    }
    int root_fd = open(argv[1], O_PATH | O_DIRECTORY | O_CLOEXEC);
    if (root_fd == -1) {
        perror("open root");
        return 1;
    }
    struct open_how how = {
        .flags = O_RDONLY | O_CLOEXEC,
        .resolve = RESOLVE_BENEATH | RESOLVE_NO_MAGICLINKS | RESOLVE_NO_SYMLINKS,
    };
    int fd = syscall(SYS_openat2, root_fd, argv[2], &how, sizeof(how));
    if (fd == -1) {
        fprintf(stderr, "DENIED: %s\n", strerror(errno));
        close(root_fd);
        return 1;
    }
    char buffer[4096];
    ssize_t count;
    while ((count = read(fd, buffer, sizeof(buffer))) > 0) {
        if (write(STDOUT_FILENO, buffer, (size_t)count) != count) {
            perror("write");
            close(fd);
            close(root_fd);
            return 1;
        }
    }
    if (count == -1)
        perror("read");
    close(fd);
    close(root_fd);
    return count == -1;
}
```

### Source, line by line

- `_GNU_SOURCE`, `linux/openat2.h`, and `sys/syscall.h` expose the Linux-specific syscall interface and `open_how` structure.
- The program accepts exactly a root and one relative request. A different shape fails with usage status 2.
- `open(..., O_PATH | O_DIRECTORY | O_CLOEXEC)` obtains a reference to the root directory without opening it for file data. `O_CLOEXEC` prevents accidental inheritance.
- `open_how.flags` requests a read-only result descriptor, also close-on-exec.
- `RESOLVE_BENEATH` rejects resolution that escapes above the supplied directory descriptor, including absolute paths.
- `RESOLVE_NO_MAGICLINKS` rejects procfs-style magic links; `RESOLVE_NO_SYMLINKS` rejects every symbolic link in the request.
- `syscall(SYS_openat2, root_fd, ...)` makes the resolution policy and open one atomic kernel request. The root descriptor, not the process working directory, is the anchor.
- A failure is printed as `DENIED` with the kernel reason and returns nonzero.
- The read/write loop copies observed bytes to standard output. It checks both input and output errors.
- Both descriptors are closed on every explicit completion path.

Build it:

```bash
cc -std=c11 -Wall -Wextra -Werror -O2 safe_open.c -o safe-open
```

### Line by line

- `-std=c11` selects the language baseline; the Linux interfaces remain explicitly requested by `_GNU_SOURCE`.
- `-Wall -Wextra -Werror` turns common warnings into build failures rather than accepting ambiguous code.
- `-O2` produces a normal optimized binary; it is not a security boundary.
- `-o safe-open` names only the lesson-local output.

## Exercise 2 - Verify allowed and denied lookups

```bash
rm -rf demo
mkdir -p demo/allowed demo/protected
printf 'allowed\n' > demo/allowed/note.txt
printf 'protected\n' > demo/protected/secret.txt
ln -s ../protected/secret.txt demo/allowed/link.txt
./safe-open demo/allowed note.txt
./safe-open demo/allowed ../protected/secret.txt || echo 'traversal denied'
./safe-open demo/allowed link.txt || echo 'symlink denied'
```

### Line by line

- The setup uses only synthetic paths in this workspace.
- The plain relative lookup prints `allowed`.
- The `..` request fails because `RESOLVE_BENEATH` will not cross above `root_fd`.
- The link request fails because `RESOLVE_NO_SYMLINKS` rejects it before following the target.
- Expected denial errors commonly report `Invalid cross-device link` for escape and `Too many levels of symbolic links` for a forbidden symlink. Match success/failure, not locale-dependent wording.

## Exercise 3 - Remove the boundary and repair it

Create a deliberately weakened copy that retains only magic-link denial:

```bash
sed 's/RESOLVE_BENEATH | RESOLVE_NO_MAGICLINKS | RESOLVE_NO_SYMLINKS/RESOLVE_NO_MAGICLINKS/' safe_open.c > unsafe_open.c
cc -std=c11 -Wall -Wextra -Werror -O2 unsafe_open.c -o unsafe-open
./unsafe-open demo/allowed ../protected/secret.txt
./unsafe-open demo/allowed link.txt
```

### Line by line

- `sed` writes a new lesson-local source; it does not alter the repaired canonical example.
- Without `RESOLVE_BENEATH`, `..` can leave the anchor. Without `RESOLVE_NO_SYMLINKS`, an ordinary symlink can be followed.
- Expected: both unsafe commands print `protected`.
- Delete `unsafe_open.c` and `unsafe-open`, then rerun the repaired denial commands. The repair is the policy in the `openat2` operation itself, not a prior string check.

`openat2` constrains only lookups made through this broker. A child can still call ordinary `open` itself. Lesson 05.03 adds process-wide future-access restrictions.

## Checkpoint and troubleshooting

```bash
test "$(./safe-open demo/allowed note.txt)" = allowed
! ./safe-open demo/allowed ../protected/secret.txt
! ./safe-open demo/allowed link.txt
```

- If `linux/openat2.h` is absent, install the distribution's normal Linux UAPI development headers; do not copy an untrusted header into the lesson.
- `ENOSYS` means the running kernel lacks `openat2`; record the exact kernel and use a supported disposable VM.
- If the safe link succeeds, confirm the repaired binary was rebuilt from `safe_open.c`.
- Checkpoint: point to the directory descriptor, the kernel resolution flags, and the single operation that joins authorization to use.
